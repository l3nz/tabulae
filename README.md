# Tabulae Elixirii

*Like what, an Elixir library for tables with a Latin name?*

Tabulae turn any named structure into a table of such structures,
that can be easily updated by supplying a new structure of that kind
with the same id.

Tabulae have the concept of indexes; you can have multiple
indexes to allow for direct access to interesting elements.

Tabulae also have the concept of streamed changes; if required, 
Tabulae can cache all changes and make them available as a 
list of updates.
